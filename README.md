# bashutils
bash scripting utilities include file 

## use case

Whether in a new project or in an existing one, we assume you want to use a bash script, `helper.sh`, 
to provide bash functions that can be used both in ci-cd/devops pipelines/workflows and in our local systems.

This way we intend to shift away from chaotic one-off commands and functions and leverage reusable solutions and patterns across distinct projects.

### one-liner setup

download a helper script for a new project with:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tgedr/bashutils/main/bashutils-template.sh -o ./helper.sh && chmod +x ./helper.sh
```

if eventually you experience issues with the corporation proxy, you still have 2 options:

- try the api:

```bash
curl -fsSL "https://api.github.com/repos/tgedr/bashutils/contents/bashutils-template.sh" \
  | python3 -c "import sys,json,base64; print(base64.b64decode(json.load(sys.stdin)['content']).decode())" \
    > ./helper.sh && chmod +x ./helper.sh
```

- try using the `gh` cli:

```bash
gh api repos/tgedr/bashutils/contents/bashutils-template.sh \
  --jq '.content' | base64 -d > ./helper.sh && chmod +x ./helper.sh
```

the downloaded file is a regular bash script that you can rename and customize for your project.

### usage

- if non-existent, it creates the files `.variables` (should be version-managed), `.local_variables` and `.secrets` (these 2 are for personal development purposes and should NOT be version-managed) next to the script
- it downloads `bashutils` on the first run
- it provides a set of logging functions
- on later runs it checks for updates at most once per day and replaces the local `bashutils` from `main` only when newer
- every downloaded `bashutils` file is verified with SHA256 using `bashutils.checksum`
- you can now reuse `bashutils` functions by referencing functions in your own `.helper.sh`:
  ```bash
  case "$1" in
    reqs)
      reqs
      ;;
    verify_env)
      verify_env
      ;;
    collect_dot_git)
      collect_dot_git "$2"
      ;;
    databricks_bundle_deploy)
      databricks_bundle_deploy "$2" "$3"
      ;;
    databricks_bundle_destroy)
      databricks_bundle_destroy "$2" "$3"
      ;;
    *)
      usage
      ;;
  esac
  ```
- you can also add your own functions directly to the `.helper.sh` script
- you are encouraged to submit PR's to contribute with new functionality to `bashutils`

## contributing

- requirements:
  - bash
  - sha256sum
  - python 3
- treat `sections/` as the source of truth for `bashutils`
- after updating `sections/`, regenerate `bashutils` with:

```bash
./helper.sh build_bashutils
```

- commit both the changed `sections/*` source files and the rebuilt `bashutils` file in the same commit/PR

## tests

this repository uses [bats-core](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) for tests:

```bash
bats test
```
